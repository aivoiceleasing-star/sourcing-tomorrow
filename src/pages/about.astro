      <p>
        SourcingTomorrow exists to equip procurement professionals with the insights, tools, and
        community they need to navigate an increasingly complex sourcing landscape. Whether you're
        managing a multi-billion-dollar supply chain or building a procurement function from scratch,
        we're here to help you make better decisions faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe procurement is one of the most strategically important functions in any
        organization, and the professionals who do this work deserve world-class resources. That's
        what we're building.

  <!-- Vision -->

      <h2 class="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-neutral-900">Our Vision</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
        <p>
          We envision a world where every procurement team, regardless of size or budget, has access to
          the same caliber of intelligence, tools, and community that were once reserved for the largest
          enterprises. Technology is leveling the playing field, and we are here to accelerate that shift.
        </p>
        <p>
          SourcingTomorrow is building the go-to platform where procurement professionals come to learn,
          connect, and sharpen their competitive edge. From AI-driven sourcing to sustainable supply chain
          strategies, we cover the trends and technologies that will define the next decade of procurement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is simple: help procurement leaders move from reactive to strategic, from cost-cutters
          to value-creators, and from siloed functions to boardroom-level influence.
